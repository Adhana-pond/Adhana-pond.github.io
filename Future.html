              <p>I am interested in many things, and would like to explore them as I grow older.</p> 
              <p>Modeling is interesting to me because, I believe that it would help me to become more confident in myself and bring out an expressive version of myself that I would like to explore.</p>
              <p>I have always wanted to become a flight attendant as I am interested in traveling. By becoming a flight attendant I would be getting paid to travel while also being able to see the world.</p>
              <p>I am interested in being a makeup artist as it is a way to express your self and there are no boundaries to it. The makeup looks one can up with are amazing and can be out of this world.</p> 
              <p>Last but not least, I would like to become a hairstylist as since i were four years old I have been doing my own hair. I would like to be able to do more styles by myself and have them look like I went to a hairdresser without paying a lot for it. Also having my own natural haircare line is important to me as many products that I have used do not work with my hair type. because of this, I would like to make one for people who may be going through it too.
